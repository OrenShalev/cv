            <li>
                <p>Love VR, especially WebVR. If you're into that, I want to hear all you have to say. If you work on VR -- I'll most likely want to work fwith or for you!</p>
                <p>Here's my first attempt at building something of my own: </p>
                <p>Also, checkout ...</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>G11N can be tedious but is also kind of fascinating. I got into G11N by leading that aspect in a product. For example, we're used to singular vs. plural in English and other languages, we're also used to it in Hebrew -- BUT many words in Hebrew have a different form when the quantity is 2. So translating nouns can't have just two forms, for Hebrew you need a third -- and the same actually goes for Russian. Also, writing direction in East-Asian languages could be very different than what a Westerner would expect. My mind is a bit blown about all that.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <p>Autonomous cars. Beyond the obvious coolness, what is it like to be an developer for THAT kind of software? And what is the level of professionalism (and stress!) a quality engineer has to have?</p>
            </li>
